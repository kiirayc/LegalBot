    "What should I do if I am stopped by immigration officers or police?":
    "Stay calm. If you need to reach for something (like ID), tell the officer first. ",
    "What if I am pulled over in a traffic stop?":
    "Ask, 'Are you from the police or immigration (ICE/CBP)?'. Immigration officers sometimes say they are police, but they are not.",
    "What if I am a U.S. citizen or have legal status?":
    "Show your documents (passport, green card, work permit, etc.).",
    "What if I am undocumented?":
    "You have the right to remain silent. You do not have to answer questions about your immigration status. Anything you say can be used against you in court.",
    "What if an immigration officer knocks on my door?":
    "Do not open the door. Teach your children not to open it. Officers need a real warrant (signed by a judge) to enter. ICE 'warrants' are not signed by judgesâ€”they do not give permission to enter without your consent.",
    "What if I see immigration officers outside?":
    "Go inside to a safe place. If you are a U.S. citizen and feel safe, you can record what is happening."
